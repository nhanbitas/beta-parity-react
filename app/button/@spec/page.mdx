## Anatomy

- **Container**: The outermost encompassing element.
- **Icon**: An optional visual element that represents the button.
- **Label**: The text that describes the action the button performs.

## States

#### Interaction states

##### Enabled

- Interaction with the button is available.

##### Hovered

- The cursor is currently positioned over the button, indicated by a different color shade and the pointer cursor.

##### Pressed

- The button is being clicked on, indicated by a different color shade.

##### Focused

- The button is focused via keyboard interaction, indicated by a ring outline.

##### Disabled

- Interaction with the button is disallowed, indicated by a muted appearance and the disallowed cursor.

##### Pending

- Action assigned to the button is being processed, indicated by an animated spinner and optional labeling.
- No further interaction is available to the user while the button is in this state.

## Options

##### Kind

- **Solid**: High visual emphasis with a solid background color.
- **Outlined**: Medium visual emphasis with a border and a light color fill.
- **Glass**: Medium-low visual emphasis with a translucent, frosted appearance.
- **Ghost**: Low visual emphasis with a transparent background.

##### Color

- Buttons are neutral-colored or achromatic by default.
- An accent color can be chosen via theme configuration and applied to buttons for enhanced visual emphasis.
- For actions that are negative or destructive in nature, an adverse color can be used.

##### Size

- Small, medium and large buttons differ in container height, minimum width and padding.
- Medium is the default button size.

##### Icon

- An icon can be added next to the button label.
- Buttons may also be icon-only.

## Behaviors

##### Minimum width

- A minimum width of 2.25× the height of the button ensures that buttons with short labels maintain identifiable shape.

##### Alignment

- Content within the button container is always center-aligned.
- The label text is also center-justified.

##### Text overflow

- When the button label is too long for the horizontal space available, it wraps to form another line.
