## Anatomy

- **Container**: The outermost encompassing element.
- **Label**: The text that describes the badge’s status, count, or category.
- **Icon**: An optional visual element that represents the badge’s status, count, or category.
- **Dot**: An optional visual element that can indicate a live status or activity. It is the [[Dot]] component.

<Image src={imageSrc.anatomy.src} alt='anatomy' />
<Image src={imageSrc.anatomyDot.src} alt='anatomy-dot' />

## States

This component does not have states.

## Options

##### Kind

- **Solid**: High visual emphasis with a solid background color.
- **Outlined**: Medium visual emphasis with a border and a light color fill.
- **Glass**: Medium-low emphasis with a translucent, frosted appearance.

<Image src={imageSrc.kind.src} alt='kind' />

##### Color

- Standard semantic colors (e.g., inactive, affirmative, cautionary, adverse, informative) and expanded colors from the design system palette are available to represent various statuses or categories.

<Image src={imageSrc.color.src} alt='color' />
<Image src={imageSrc.color2.src} alt='color2' />


##### Size

- Badge sizes vary in height, padding, and icon/dot size to ensure visual harmony across small, medium, and large badges.

<Image src={imageSrc.sizeSmall.src} alt='sizeSmall' />
<Image src={imageSrc.sizeMedium.src} alt='sizeMedium' />
<Image src={imageSrc.sizeLarge.src} alt='sizeLarge' />


##### Icon

- An icon can be optionally added next to the badge label to provide additional visual context.

<Image src={imageSrc.icon.src} alt='icon' />


##### Dot

- A Dot component can be added next to the badge label to indicate a live status or activity.

<Image src={imageSrc.dot.src} alt='dot' />

## Behaviors

##### Minimum width

- A badge’s minimum width is set equal to its height, ensuring a circular shape when the content is minimal (e.g., single-digit numbers).

<Image src={imageSrc.minWidth.src} alt='minWidth' />

##### Text overflow

- When the badge label exceeds the available horizontal space, it is truncated with an ellipsis to maintain visual integrity.

<Image src={imageSrc.overflow.src} alt='overflow' />
