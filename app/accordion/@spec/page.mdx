##### Layering

- Menus are available in default or alternative [[Layering]].

##### Grouping

- Menu items can be grouped together.
- Menu groups are separated by dividers.
- A label can be optionally added to a menu group.

##### Scroll buttons

- For menus where the number of menu items exceeds the available space, by default, scroll buttons are shown at the top and/or bottom of the menu to indicate that there are more items to view in the respective direction.
- The user may scroll through the menu items by clicking the scroll buttons.

##### Checkmark side

- Selection checkmarks can be positioned to the left or right of menu item labels.
- Left-side checkmarks are incompatible with icons.

##### Checkbox input

- Selection checkmarks can be replaced by checkbox inputs, suitable for use with multiple-choice select fields.

##### Radio input

- Selection checkmarks can be replaced by radio inputs, suitable for use with single-choice select fields.

##### Color

- Menu items are neutral-colored or achromatic by default.
- An accent color can be chosen via theme configuration and applied to menu items for enhanced visual emphasis.

##### Selection prominence

- **Subtle**: The background color of selected menu items has a low level of contrast in comparison to unselected menu items.
- **Pronounced**: The background color of selected menu items has a high level of contrast in comparison to unselected menu items.

##### Size

- Small and medium menu items differ in container height.
- Medium is the default size.

##### Icon

- An icon can be optionally added to the left of the menu item label.

##### Filter input

- A filter input can be optionally added to the top of the menu to allow the user to filter for menu item labels that match the search query.
- A message is displayed when no matching menu items are found.

## Behaviors

##### Label alignment

- The start position of all menu item labels are always aligned.

##### Text overflow

- When the menu item label is too long for the horizontal space available, it is truncated with an ellipsis.

##### Menu positioning

- Menus are positioned below the select field or action button that triggers them.
- If the menu would extend beyond the viewport, it is repositioned above the trigger element.
